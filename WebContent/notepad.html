    In Shaivism tradition, Shiva is one of the supreme beings who creates, protects and transforms the universe.
    In the Shaktism tradition, the Goddess, or Devi, is described as one of the supreme,
    yet Shiva is revered along with Vishnu and Brahma.

    <p>The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent around his neck,
    the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair,
    the third eye on his forehead, the trishula or trident, as his weapon,
    and the damaru drum. He is usually worshipped in the aniconic form of lingam.
